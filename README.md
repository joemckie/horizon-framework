Horizon is an extremely powerful framework to run WordPress websites on. Here are a few of its features:

* **Awesome customisable admin panel.** - Add a new option by simply adding a new array!

* **Real time typography previews.** - Edit font size, colour, decoration, transform, and choose from over 300 Google Fonts, and see the result in *real-time*!
* **Dragon & Drop Page Builder** - Visually edit the layout of your pages using the drag-&-drop page builder. The options for each element are easily editable, too!
* **Ability to have multiple style options.** - Ideal for theme developers, or a site with a userbase which is allowed to edit the way they view the site. You can choose an entirely different layout for elements such as blog posts.
* **Various choice of thumbnails** - You can choose from a featured image, slider, video (vimeo/youtube), audio (soundcloud), quote or link thumbnail!
* **18 Prebuilt shortcodes** - Make your posts as feature rich as your pages!
